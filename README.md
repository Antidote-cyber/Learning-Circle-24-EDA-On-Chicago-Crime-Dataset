# EDA on Chicago Crime Dataset using Python and Python libraries
This repository was created alongside ALTSchool Circle 24 teammates in fulfillment of the team's project work in Data science. The data was collected from the chicago data portal.
The jupyter notebook used for this exploration can be found in this repository. All other information such as the dataset can be found in the resources down below.

## Introduction
According to Neighborhoodscout.com, Chicago has one of the highest crime rate in the country compared to other communities and countries in the United States. The statistics shows that one in every 27 person is a victim of theft or violent crime. This EDA aims to show locations where these crimes occur the most, overall trend of crime by time of day, season, community area where crimes occur the most. Generally we would be exploring the data to better understand crime trends in Chicago.

## Methodology
In this exploratory data analysis, python was the language of choice and several other libraries listed below were used to aid in our analysis
1. Pandas - For manipulating and storing dataframes 
2. Numpy - To perform mathematical operations and work with multi-dimensional arrays
3. Matplotlib - For custom visualization
4. Seaborn - For visualization
5. Plotly - For a more interactive visualization and displaying maps
6. Datetime - To manipulate and show trend analysis
7. Calendar - To work with the datetime functions

## Results
From the results, theft is highest crime that occurs in virtually all parts of Chicago and this crime usually happens on the street.
